OpenSSH and SSH are interchangable terms.

OpenSSH is available on most platforms.

SSH client allows you to connect to other machines, but doesn't allow them to
connect to you. To see if you have it installed:
    which ssh

SSH client package is usually installed by default. On debian-based systems you
can search for it with:
    apt search openssh-client

In the square brackets on the right, it will tell you if it's installed or not.
(Square brackets won't be there if it's not)
