# The `uname` command

[***Table of Contents***](/README.md)

This command is used to print basic system information. By default, it only
prints the kernel name:

```bash
uname
```

To print all information about the system:

```bash
uname -a
```

To print the kernel version (*release in `uname`'s terms*):

```bash
uname -r
```

To print the hostname:

```bash
uname -n
```

As always, check out the documentation for extra:

```bash
man uname
```
