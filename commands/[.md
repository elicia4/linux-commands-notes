# `[`

[***Table of Contents***](/README.md)

It's a syntactically convenient substitute for `test`:

```bash
[ 0 ]
echo $?
```

You can write a single line if-statement using the `[` (square bracket)
command:

```bash
if [ 5 -gt 3 ]; then echo "a"; else echo "b"; fi
if /usr/bin/[ 5 -gt 3 ]; then echo "a"; else echo "b"; fi
if /usr/bin/test 5 -gt 3; then echo "a"; else echo "b"; fi
```

In both scenarios, the expression to evaluate and the closing square bracket
`]` are passed like regular arguments.

In practice, this command can be confusing due to the fact that `test` and `[`
can both exist as built-in shell features or standalone executables:

```bash
type -a [
type -a test
which [
which test
```

In the GNU corelib's implementation of `test` you can see that `test` and `[`
are implemented by the same piece of source code.

Furthermore, you can see that the man pages of these two commands are
completely identical:

```bash
vim -d <(man [) <(man test)
```
