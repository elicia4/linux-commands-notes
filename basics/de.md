# Desktop Environments

Notes taken on the "Linux Crash Course - Desktop Environments" video by
Learn Linux TV.

[***go back to README***](/README.md)

### What is a "Desktop Environment"?

- A Graphical User Interface (GUI) for your Linux install
- DE's are separate and interchangeable components
- On Windows Server, GUI is also optional
- Server-oriented Linux distros often won't have a DE by default

### Desktop Environments vs Window Managers

- A window manager manages application windows... that's basically it.
- Although WM's are a separate component, some Linux users use them by
  themselves.
- DE's combine a window manager with quality of life features
- Window managers are extremely basic in terms of features
- Window managers need a lot less memory to run
- WM's are harder to set up than DE's

### GNOME

To see the larger interface, click on the "Activities" button at the top right.
At the bottom, you will see applications that were set as favorites. You can
"Unpin" applications by right-clicking on them. 

The last button in the row is the Applications menu, represented by three rows
of three white circles. There's a default text editor and a file manager
Nautilus, it was renamed to Files. You can change the default view to a list
view in Files by clicking on the leftmost button at the top right. There are
many other functions to this file manager.

You can get to the Activities screen by pressing the Super key. There's also a 
System Monitor app built in into the system. There's also a GNOME Software app,
you can install apps there. The favorites menu at the bottom is called Dash,
you can pin new apps to it. There's also a default web browser available called
"Web".

You can get on overview of all the open applications by pressing the Super key
and then selecting the app you want to work with. You can also open a new
workspace there, just click on the one peeking on the right side. To switch
between workspaces, click `<CTRL+ALT>` and use left and right arrows. GNOME
features dynamic workspaces, they open and close depending on what's happening.

Have a few applications per workspace, have one for system management, other
for notes, another for server management etc.

You can customize everything in the settings app.

GNOME is a set-it-and-forget-it type of DE. 

GNOME sees a lot of customization by Linux distro developers, Ubuntu's
implementation is different, for example.

### Plasma

It resembles Windows. It's inspired by Windows. 

Its default file manager is Dolphin, which is one of the most featureful file
managers today. You can zoom in and zoom out, you can set up different views
for the file manager in the top left. It's also configurable, press the
horizontal lines icon in the top right corner, select `Configure` and then
`Configure Dolphin...`.

The application launcher in the bottom left of the screen is self-explanatory.
Take a look at the menus in the bottom right corner. There's KDE Connect that
allows you to see notifications on your mobile devices if you pair them to your
Desktop. There's a device menu as well. The bottom right button is the "Show
Desktop" button minimizes and maximizes all the applications you have opened.

The Discover app is the software app of Plasma.

In the System Settings app, you can customize your system. You can even
customize the animation speed.

### Cinnamon

It's used by the Linux Mint distribution. It benefits from hardware
acceleration, it utilizes the GPU whenever it makes sense to do so. It kinda
looks like Plasma.

You have the application launcher in the bottom left. The "Show Desktop" button
works the same way as the "Show Desktop" button in Plasma.

The file manager is Nemo, it's less customizable than Dolphin, it probably more
options than GNOME Files and fewer than Dolphin. 

View change is available in the top right corner. You can change the panel on
the left side in the bottom left corner and even hide the panel completely.

The configurations are available in `Edit -> Preferences`.

The workspaces functionality is also available in Plasma. To show workspaces, 
press `<CTRL+ALT+UP>`. You can even rename your workspaces. Add new ones by
pressing the big button on the right. 

You can enable a workspace switcher. Right-click the panel at the bottom, click
on `Panel edit mode`, then click on `Applets`, scroll down, select `Workspace
switcher`, click on the `+`. You can see it in the bottom panel now. You can
customize it by pressing on the cogs button in the Applets app. Select `Simple
buttons` in `Type of display`. Now disable the edit mode.

Cinnamon has a great deal of customization in System Settings, open up the app
launcher and click on the settings button on the left. Go to Themes and
customize the DE to your liking.
