# `mkdir`

[***Table of Contents***](/README.md)

The command is used to create new directories:

```bash
mkdir new_dir another_new_dir ...
```

You can create directories using relative and absolute paths:

```bash
mkdir ../dir_up
mkdir /home/test2
```

`-p` to make parent directories if they don't exist (by default an error
appears):

```bash
mkdir -p dir1/dir2
```
