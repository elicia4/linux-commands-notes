What is OpenSSH?

OpenSSH is a remote management tool, that gives you access to run commands on
another machine. 
It was developed by the OpenBSD project.
It's the closest thing to a standard for remote access we have in the Linux
community.
It's a suite of utilities, the most important of which are the server and the
client components.

SSH uses port 22.
There are going to be several hops between your PC and whatever device you have
to configure. All of them have to allow SSH connections.
