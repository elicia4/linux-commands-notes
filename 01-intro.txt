There are many tools included in systemd. It allows you manage resources, it is
the most common init system. 

An init system is the most important process, it is the first process that 
starts on your system, its job is to schedule all other processes. 

Topics discussed:

	Basic commands:
		such as starting, stopping, restarting services, etc.
	More complext aspects of systemd, such as:
		service files
		directory priority
		...

What is "Systemd"?

	- It's an "init system", it's a type of process (any task that runs in the
	  background) 
	- It's the most important process running on your system, it's the first
	  process that runs when you start your Linux instance. For that reason
	  init systems are referred to as PID1 (proccess ID #1). 
	- Its job is to manage all other processes, or services that run in the
	  background. When you start a process, the request to do it is sent to the
	  init system, which then starts it up. It works similiarly when you stop,
	  reload, and restart a process.

Working with Units:
	
	- Units in Systemd refer to resources it's able to manage for you
	- These include services, timers, mounts, automounts, and so on
	- We will focus on services, but it's a good idea to keep in mind that
	  there are other types of units

	In summary, units are what systemd can manage for you and a service is a
	type of unit.
