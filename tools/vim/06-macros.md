# 06. Macros 

[***go back to README***](README.md)

Think of a macro as a mini script that will perform a number of actions.  
We can record a macro to any of the 26 registers (represented by `[a-z]`).

You can start recording macros with `q`.  
`q` will also stop recording macros.

Use `@` followed by the register you recorded the macro on to play it back.  
You can also put a number before `@` to play it back a certain number of times.

Macros are extremely useful for repetitive actions.

Once vim reaches the end of the file, it will stop playing your macro, so feel
free to run it more times that it needs to (be careful though).

Try using a macro on the following sentence:

>I want each word of this sentence to be on a new line
