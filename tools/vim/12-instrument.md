# Vim Is Not An Editor, It's An Instrument!

[***Table of Contents***](README.md)

These are notes on [this video by
Beginbot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJqnWXDJZr0).

Vim is an instrument, it takes time to learn an instrument. It's a complicated
tool that takes time and practice to learn.

### Learning Expectations

- First Week of Halo isn't that bad 
- First Year of Violin is rough

### Vim is an instrument

You don't know what you're going to type, but you use various building blocks 
and tools:
- shortcuts
- techniques
- commands
- phrases
- licks
- riffs

### Vim Vocabulary

You build vocabulary one step at a time. Vim vocabulary lives at different
levels of conciousness, in different situations. You have to find where they
all go.

## Theory

You can use techniques for learning to improvise in music, to learn to use Vim
better.

Basic Guitar: 3 chords, 5 notes to solo. You're ready for a full career.
Basic Vim: open, close, save files, move around, write some text, change some
text, use different modes - you can do basic editing. 

The assumption is that you can do basic editing, the goal is to teach you to
fish. 

You read new books, take new courses, read the documentation. You add to your
own pile and build your own tools. You learn alone in the practice room.

### Practice Versus Performance

Have a practice journal!

```bash
# vim journal
alias vj="$EDITOR ~/journals/Vim.md" 
```
```md
# Current Vim Goals

## Annoyed With

## Researching

## Experimenting With

## Working On

```

### What is Practice

- Record What you're Working On
- Record What you want to Work On
- Be concious of when in you're each mode

Focus the practice time. Like the Gym doesn't have to be long.

What is practice time?
- take notes
- do research
- experiment with things
- repeat things

### 3 Levels of Knowledge

Vim Vocab lives at 3 different levels

1. Aware of it
1. Can perform it, but isn't reached for automatically
1. Under the fingers without thought

When you learn new techniques:
1. Know what technique you're working on specifically
1. Understand what knowledge level each technique is on

How do you know what's worth moving between levels? Do what feels good for you,
it will influence how often you will actually use different things!

Some stuff doesn't feel good at the beginning and is uncomfortable, so you need
to know if it's worth investing your time into it. It's not a big deal to try
something out and abandon it.

### Warming Up

When you warm up, you're trying to move techniques between levels.

- choose some vim vocab that you want to master
- create some simple exercises
- keep adjusting as you learn
- over time, you will get used it
- once you get bored, try something new!

Start out simple and move on to more complicated stuff. Practice in `:help` or
wherever else you want!

### Games and Exercises

- Vim Golf
  - find a thing you do most often and try to accomplish it in as few
  keystrokes as possible

### Artifical Restrictions

- Choose something not to use (for example `j` spamming)
- Make it annoying to use it
- Or even *impossible to use* (disable arrow keys)

### Feature Overuse

- `c` for everything
- use `:g` all the time
- Visual Mode 24/7

### Jamming with Others

Take a look at how others use vim!

- Take Notes
    - Figure out their sources
        - :help
    - Figure out their use cases
    - Ask what they used to have
- Try out other people's styles
- Get the surrounding tips, not just the lick (the main thing)
- Look to the masters of their craft (Ask the Lua Plugin God)

### Wrap Up

- Practice vs. Play
- Keep a Vim Practice Journal
- Warm Ups ain't just physical
- Play Games:
    - Restrict 
    - Overuse
- Jam with Others
- Have fun, don't take things too serious!
