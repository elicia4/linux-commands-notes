# Window Management in `tmux`

[**Contents**](01-intro.md)

You can have different windows in `tmux`, each of them has different panes.

When you create a `tmux` session, you work in a window by default. Start a
`tmux` session. Create a new window inside of `tmux` like so:

    tmux new-window

At the bottom, you can see there are two windows now, window "0" and window
"1". Their names are named after what they're running.

When you create a window, they start at the next available number. An easier
way to create a window is `<prefix-key>` + `c`, `c` for "create". 

To switch between windows, use `prefix + p` for previous or `prefix + n` for
next. The window you are currently using is indicated by an `*`.

To kill a window, run `prefix + &`. Confirm with `y`.

Note the window numbers, they remain the same, a window gets assigned a number
on its creation.

You can rename a window `prefix + ,`. Enter a new name. Whenever you launch an
application in this window, its name won't change. You can name every window
after its function. Another way to rename:

    tmux rename-window <new-name>

Reattach and attach back for practice.
