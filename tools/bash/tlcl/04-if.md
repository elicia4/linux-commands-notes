# Flow Control: `if`

[***Table of Contents***](./00-contents.md)

You can make your script decide what to do based on the result of a test, with
the `if` statement. For example:

```
X = 10

If X = 10, then:
    Say "X equals 10."
Otherwise:
    Say "X does not equal 10."
```

This is an example of a branch in pseudocode. The same can be expressed with
`sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

x=5

if [ "$x" -eq 5 ]; then
    echo "x equals 5."
else
    echo "x does not equal 5."
fi
```

The `if` statement has the following syntax:

```bash
if commands; then
    commands
[elif commands; then
    commands...]
[else
    commands]
fi
```

### Exit Codes

Shell decides whether or not the test succeeded or failed based on the *exit
status* of the test. An *exit status* is a value issued by a command to the
system when it terminates. The value ranges from 0 to 255. Conventionally,
**0** indicates **success** and **all other values** indicate **failure**. The
exit code of the last command is stored in the `?` shell parameter:

```bash
ls -d /usr/bin
echo $? # success, 0
ls -d /bin/usr
echo $? # failure, not 0
```

Some commands use different exit status values to provide diagnostics for
errors, while many commands simply exit with a value of 1 when they fail. Man
pages typically describe what exit codes are used in the "Exit Status" section.
Zero always indicates success.

There are two commands that terminate with either a 0 or 1 exit status:

```bash
true
echo $? # 0
false
echo $? # 1
```

You can use these to see how the `if` statement works:

```bash
if true; then echo "Tis' true."; fi
if false; then echo "Tis' true."; fi
```

The `echo` command only executes when the command following `if` succeeds. If
there's multiple commands following `if`, only the last command is evaluated
and affects the test:

```bash
if ls /bin/usr; true; then echo "It's true."; fi
```

Note that `ls /bin/usr` got executed anyway.

### `test`

The command frequently used with `if` is `test`. It performs a variety of
checks and comparisons, it has two forms:

```bash
test expression # 1
[ expression ]  # 2
```

*expression* is evaluated as either *true* or *false*. `test` returns (an exit
status of) 0 if the expression is *true* and a status of 1 when it's *false*.

Both `test` and `[` are commands, they're builtins in bash, but they also exist
in `/usr/bin` for use with other shells. The expression is `[`'s arguments
requiring the `]` character to be provided as its last argument.

### File Expressions:

- `file1 -ef file2` - `file1` and `file2` have the same inode numbers;
- `file1 -nt file2` - `file1` is newer than `file2`;
- `file1 -ot file2` - `file1` is older than `file2`;
- `-e file` - `file` exists;

`file` exists and:
- `-b file` - is a block-special file;
- `-c file` - is a character-special file;
- `-d file` - is a directory;
- `-f file` - is a regular file;
- `-g file` - is set-group-ID;
- `-G file` - is owned by the effective group ID;
- `-k file` - has its "sticky bit" set;
- `-L file` - is a symbolic link;
- `-O file` - is owned by the effective user ID;
- `-p file` - is a named pipe;
- `-r file` - is readable (has readable permission for the effective user);
- `-s file` - has a length greater than zero;
- `-S file` - is a network socket;
- `-t fd` - `fd` is a file descriptor directed to/from the terminal. This can
  be used to determine whether standard input/output/ error is being
  redirected;
- `-u file` - is setuid;
- `-w file` - is writable;
- `-x file` - is executable/searchable by the effective user.

Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash 

# test-file: Evaluate the status of a file 

FILE=~/.bashrc 
if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then 
    if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then # if a file
        echo "$FILE is a regular file." 
    fi 
    if [ -d "$FILE" ]; then # if a directory
        echo "$FILE is a directory." 
    fi 
    if [ -r "$FILE" ]; then # if readable
        echo "$FILE is readable." 
    fi 
    if [ -w "$FILE" ]; then # if writable
        echo "$FILE is writable." 
    fi 
    if [ -x "$FILE" ]; then # if executable
        echo "$FILE is executable/searchable." 
    fi 
else 
    echo "$FILE does not exist" # if it doesn't exist
    exit 1 # indicates that there was an error
fi 

exit # formality, otherwise the exit status of the last command is returned
```

### String Expressions

- `string` - `string` is not null;
- `-n string` - The length of `string` is greater than zero;
- `-z string` - The length of `string` is zero;
- `string1 = string2` or `string1 == string2` - `string1` and `string2` are
  equal. Single or double - equal signs may be used. The use of double equal
  signs is supported by bash and is generally preferred, but it is not POSIX
  compliant;
- `string1 != string2` - `string1` and `string2` are not equal;
- `string1 > string2` - `string1` sorts after `string2`;
- `string1 < string2` - `string1` sorts before `string2`.

**WARNING**: the `>` and `<` expression operators must be quoted when used with
test. If they are not, they will be interpreted by the shell as redirection
operators, with potentially destructive results. 

Here's an example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash 

# test-string: evaluate the value of a string 

ANSWER=maybe 

if [ -z "$ANSWER" ]; then 
    echo "There is no answer." >&2 # directs to STDERR, proper thing to do
    exit 1 
fi 

if [ "$ANSWER" = "yes" ]; then 
    echo "The answer is YES." 
elif [ "$ANSWER" = "no" ]; then 
    echo "The answer is NO." 
elif [ "$ANSWER" = "maybe" ]; then 
    echo "The answer is MAYBE." 
else 
    echo "The answer is UNKNOWN." 
fi
```

### Integer Expressions

- `integer1 -eq integer2` - `integer1` is equal to `integer2`;
- `integer1 -ne integer2` - `integer1` is not equal to `integer2`;
- `integer1 -le integer2` - `integer1` is less than or equal to `integer2`;
- `integer1 -lt integer2` - `integer1` is less than `integer2`;
- `integer1 -ge integer2` - `integer1` is greater than or equal to `integer2`;
- `integer1 -gt integer2` - `integer1` is greater than `integer2`.

Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash 

# test-integer: evaluate the value of an integer. 

INT=-5 

if [ -z "$INT" ]; then 
    echo "INT is empty." >&2 
    exit 1 
fi 

if [ "$INT" -eq 0 ]; then 
    echo "INT is zero." 
else 
    if [ "$INT" -lt 0 ]; then 
        echo "INT is negative." 
    else 
        echo "INT is positive." 
    fi 
    if [ $((INT % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then 
        echo "INT is even." 
    else 
        echo "INT is odd." 
    fi 
fi
```

### A Newer Version of `test`

Modern versions of bash include an enhanced replacement for `test`. It uses the
following syntax: 

```bash
[[ expression ]]
```

It supports all the expressions of the regular `test`, but also adds an
important new one:

```bash
string1 =~ regex
```

This returns true if `string1` is matched by the extended regular expression
`regex`. This extends the possibilities dramatically, for example the previous
script can be improved so that the data may contain symbols are other than
numbers:

```bash
#!/bin/bash 

# test-integer2: evaluate the value of an integer. 

INT=-5 

if [[ "$INT" =~ ^-?[0-9]+$ ]]; then # starts with a `-`, followed N digits
    if [ "$INT" -eq 0 ]; then 
        echo "INT is zero." 
    else 
        if [ "$INT" -lt 0 ]; then 
            echo "INT is negative." 
        else 
            echo "INT is positive." 
        fi 
        if [ $((INT % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then 
            echo "INT is even." 
        else 
            echo "INT is odd." 
        fi 
    fi 
else 
    echo "INT is not an integer." >&2 
    exit 1 
fi
```

This regex also eliminates the possibility of empty values.

Another added feature of `[[ ]]` is that the `==` operator supports pattern
matching the same way pathname expansion does:

```bash
FILE=foo.bar 
if [[ $FILE == foo.* ]]; then echo "$FILE matches pattern 'foo.*'"; fi 
# foo.bar matches pattern 'foo.*'
```

This makes `[[ ]]` useful for evaluating file and pathnames.

### `(( ))` - Command for Integer Operations

It supports arithmetic evaluations. It also performs arithmetic truth tests,
which result in true if the result is non-zero:

```bash
if ((1)); then echo "It is true."; fi
if ((0)); then echo "It is true."; fi
```

The previous script can be simplified even further with this command:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# test-integer2a: evaluate the value of an integer. 

INT=-5 

if [[ "$INT" =~ ^-?[0-9]+$ ]]; then 
    if ((INT == 0)); then 
        echo "INT is zero." 
    else 
        if ((INT < 0)); then 
            echo "INT is negative." 
        else 
            echo "INT is positive." 
        fi 
        if (( ((INT % 2)) == 0)); then 
            echo "INT is even." 
        else 
            echo "INT is odd." 
        fi 
    fi 
else 
    echo "INT is not an integer." >&2 
    exit 1 
fi
```

We can use `<`, `>`, and `==` (to test equivalence). This syntax is a lot more
natural and understandable.

`(( ))` is part of the shell syntax rather than an ordinary command, and it
deals only with integers, so it is able to recognize variables by name and does
not require expansion to be performed.

### Logical Expressions

There are three logical operations for `test` and `[[ ]]`: `AND`, `OR` and
`NOT`.

`test`(`[ ]`) and `[[ ]]` with `(( ))` use different operators to represent
these operations:

| Operation  | `test` or `[ ]` | `[[ ]]` `(( ))` |
|-------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| AND | `-a` | `&&` |
| OR | `-o` | `\|\|` |
| NOT | `!` | `!` |

For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash 

# determine if an integer is within a specified range of values. 

MIN_VAL=1
MAX_VAL=100 

INT=50 

if [[ "$INT" =~ ^-?[0-9]+$ ]]; then 
    if [[ "$INT" -ge "$MIN_VAL" && "$INT" -le "$MAX_VAL" ]]; then 
        echo "$INT is within $MIN_VAL to $MAX_VAL." 
    else 
        echo "$INT is out of range." 
    fi 
else 
    echo "INT is not an integer." >&2 
    exit 1 
fi
```

The test could've also been coded this way:

```bash
if [ "$INT" -ge "$MIN_VAL" -a "$INT" -le "$MAX_VAL" ]; then 
    echo "$INT is within $MIN_VAL to $MAX_VAL." 
else 
    echo "$INT is out of range." 
fi
```

It's quite clear which one is more intuitive. 

To reverse the previous test, that is, to find the values *outside* of the
specified range:

```bash
#!/bin/bash 

# determine if an integer is outside a specified range of values. 

MIN_VAL=1 
MAX_VAL=100 

INT=50 

if [[ "$INT" =~ ^-?[0-9]+$ ]]; then 
    if [[ ! ("$INT" -ge "$MIN_VAL" && "$INT" -le "$MAX_VAL") ]]; then
        echo "$INT is outside $MIN_VAL to $MAX_VAL." 
    else 
        echo "$INT is in range." 
    fi 
else 
    echo "INT is not an integer." >&2 
    exit 1 
fi
```

Notice the parentheses around the expression, if these were not included, the
negation would only apply to the first expression and not the combination of
the two. Same condition coded with `test`:

```bash
if [ ! \( "$INT" -ge "$MIN_VAL" -a "$INT" -le "$MAX_VAL" \) ]; 
then 
    echo "$INT is outside $MIN_VAL to $MAX_VAL." 
else 
    echo "$INT is in range." 
fi
```

Since all expressions and operators used by test are treated as command
arguments by the shell (unlike `[[ ]]` and `(( ))` ), characters that have
special meaning to bash, such as `<`, `>`, `(`, and `)`, must be quoted or
escaped.

Note that `[[ ]]` is specific to `bash`, it's clearly easier to code with it,
so it's preferred to use it for modern scripts. `test` is preferred for startup
scripts.

### Branching with `&&` and `||`

bash provides two control operators that can perform branching. `&&` and `||`
work like the logical operators in the `[[ ]]`. Here's their syntax:

```bash
command1 && command2 # command2 is only executed if command1 succeeds
command1 || command2 # command2 is only executed if command1 fails
```

For example:

```bash
mkdir temp && cd temp # will only cd if the directory was created
[[ -d temp ]] || mkdir temp # will only mkdir if the folder temp doesn't exist
```

This is especially useful for handling errors:

```bash
[[ -d temp ]] || exit 1 # if temp doesn't exist, terminate with exit status 1
```

### `sys_info_page` Script

We can now check for permissions in `sys_info_page`:

```bash
report_home_space () { 
    if [[ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ]]; then # root is always 0 UID
        cat <<- _EOF_ 
            <h2>Home Space Utilization (All Users)</h2> 
            <pre>$(du -sh /home/*)</pre> 
            _EOF_ 
    else 
        cat <<- _EOF_
        <h2>Home Space Utilization ($USER)</h2> 
        <pre>$(du -sh $HOME)</pre> 
        _EOF_ 
    fi 
    return 
}
```
