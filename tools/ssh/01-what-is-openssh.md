### What is OpenSSH?

OpenSSH is a remote management tool developed by the OpenBSD project that gives
you access to run commands on another machine. 

- it's the closest thing to a standard for remote access we have in the Linux
community. 
`ssh` is a suite of utilities, the most important of which are the server and
the client components;
- by default, `ssh` uses port 22;

There are going to be several hops between your PC and whatever device you have
to configure. *All of them* have to allow SSH connections.
