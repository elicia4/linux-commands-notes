# Contents and a Note of Caution

Don't view these notes as a shortened version of the book. I omitted the stuff
I already knew or didn't personally find useful.

1. [What is a shell?](01-shell.md)
1. [Navigation](02-navigation.md)
1. [Exploring the System](03-exploring.md)
1. [Files and Directories](04-files-and-dirs.md)
1. [Working with Commands](05-working-with-command.md)

TO-DO:
1. Add links to contents at the beginning of each file.
2. Add links to finished chapters.
