Personal suggestions:

1. Write your own scripts. Automate whatever you've always wanted to automate.

2. If you don't write scripts often, refresh the syntax from time to time.

3. Explore other bash resources; a lot is covered here:  
   https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide  
   https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html

4. To check your scripts for bugs, use:

Note that MANY things were not covered in these notes, only the stuff for 
beginners.
