Let's take a look at how systemd is structured, more specifically let's take a
look at directories where unit files are stored.

systemd uses unit files. A unit files pertains to anything that systemd can
manage. systemd looks at files to figure out how it needs to interact with
processes. 

Service files are just text files that contain instructions that tell systemd
how to run those services.

Directories that are most common for service files are:

    /etc/systemd/system - the most common directory
    /run/systemd/system/ 
    /lib/systemd/system/ 

Take a look at the contents of this directory /lib/systemd/system/. There are
many different types of unit files in there, such as .target, .socket, .service,
.timer. Keep in mind that there are different types of unit files, not just
services.

Each one of the directories listed above has a specific purpose. You don't have
to create your own unit files since they mostly come preinstalled, they are 
located inside /lib/systemd/system/. Runtime systemd units are located inside 
/run/systemd/system/, you won't visit this directory often. The
/etc/systemd/system/ is the directory you will most commonly work with.

Priority of directories: /etc/systemd/system/ -> /run/systemd/system/ ->
/lib/systemd/system/. Higher priority unit files take priority over lower
priority unit files. If you put anything inside /etc... it will have utmost 
priority. You should put your own service files inside /etc/... to make sure the
service file is taken into account. Make sure to keep your service files in
/etc because if a package gets updated it can overwrite the unit files inside
the /lib/ folder.

Let's take a closer look at systemd unit files.
