Docker is a platfrom that runs containers
A container bundles an app's code and all its dependancies into one object
Containers typically use less resources that VM's
Docker containers can run almost anywhere
Containers can be easily copied and deployed
Apps that run in containers are segregated from the rest of the host system
Containers can often be cheaper to run than VM's
Docker containers can be run on platforms such as AWS, Linode, Digital Ocean,
Google Cloud, and others
Not all apps are supported when run in containers
Although Docker is aweseme, it's one tool among many
