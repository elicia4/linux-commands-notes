Start with a container that is a close to what you want to achieve as possible
	docker run -it ubuntu
	apt update
	apt dist-upgrade
	apt install apache2
	/etc/init.d/apache2 status
	/etc/init.d/apache2 start
	apt install vim
Disconnect from the container: CTRL + p + q
Check if its running with
	docker ps
How does one save a container?
	docker ps -> copy container ID
	docker commit 32containerid lltv/apache-test:1.0
View docker images:
	docker images
Stop running container
	docker stop 12containerid
Create container with the saved image:
	docker run -d -it -p 8080:80 lltv/apache-test:1.0
Check server from browser - paste ip:8080 to search.
Apache isn't running? Why isn't it running? No entry point! What is an entry
point? It's essentially an instruction to docker about what command should be
run when a new container is created from an image. To create the needed entry
point type:
	docker commit --change='ENTRYPOINT ["apachectl", "-DFOREGROUND"]' <ID> lltv/apache-test:1.1
Stop previous container:
	docker stop <ID>
Launch the new one:
	docker run -d -it -p 8080:80 lltv/apache-test:1.1
Check the website again, the web server should be working now :)

Let's automate all this!
Create a new folder, cd into it. Create a file named 'Dockerfile'.

Inside the file, type(comments aren't required):
###############################################
# Set the container image you want to start from
FROM ubuntu
# Set the maintainer variable
MAINTAINER John <john@someplace.com>
# Update packages
# RUN keyword runs the following command inside the container
RUN apt update; apt dist-upgrade -y
# Install packages
RUN apt install -y apache2 vim
# Set entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT apache2ctl -D FOREGROUND
###############################################

THIS CAN FAIL because of prompts, you should make the process noninteractive.
Add the following after "MAINTAINER" line:
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

The file should be working now :)

Run "docker ps". Want to get rid of an image? Use:
	docker rmi <IMAGE-ID>
And... It didn't work. The error is right. Run "docker ps -a", you can probably
find the container.
Delete all the containers that use the image:
	docker rm <CONTAINER-ID>
After you delete all of them (BE CAREFUL, DON'T DELETE THE STUFF YOU NEED), you
will be able to delete the image:
	docker rmi <IMAGE-ID>
