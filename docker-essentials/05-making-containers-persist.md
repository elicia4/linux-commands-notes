If a container has nothing to do, it deletes itself.
Let's explore how to keep the container running in the
background
	docker run -it ubuntu
Means the same thing as
	docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
To run a container in the background:
	docker run -it -d ubuntu
-it creates an interactive shell inside the container, =>
creates an interactive container
-d activates daemon mode(daemon is another word for service)
To connect to a container running in the background:
	docker attach <container-id>
	(to get container id: docker ps -> copy container id)
You can shorten the id to the combination of unique characters,
imagine you have the following ID's:
	06asdfasdf, 0701230912dj
If you run 'docker attach 06' it will launch the container
starting with '06'
To send the container back to the background, CTRL+P+Q
