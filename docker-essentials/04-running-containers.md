Show docker images that have been downloaded and are locally available:
	docker images
Look for a docker image, for example the ubuntu image:
	docker search ubuntu
Download docker image:
	docker pull ubuntu
Run a container created from that image:
	docker run ubuntu
So... you are back to the prompt. Containers automatically exit if they
have nothing to do. Some containers start running some job whenever they start,
but it's not the case with ubuntu. Try running:
	docker run nginx
If a docker image doesn't exist locally but is available, it will be
downloaded automatically and launched if you run the 'docker run image-name'
command.
List containters that are running on your system:
	docker ps
List all containers:
	docker ps -a
Run bash inside ubuntu container:
	docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
You are now 'inside' the container! Do whatever you want!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Containers don't save changes by default.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Update the system:
	apt update
Install vim:
	apt install vim
You can install anything you want!
You can even install a GUI app from containers.
You should practice settings up containers :)
For instance, you could practice using various package managers on popular
distributions
