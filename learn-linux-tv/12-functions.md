# Functions

A function allows you to define a set of tasks and call those tasks at once by
calling the function.

Let's add functions to the update script. Simplify the case when an error
occurs.

To define a function:

```
function_name() {
    *anything*
} 
```

A function allows us to execute repeating sets of commands by only defining
them once.
