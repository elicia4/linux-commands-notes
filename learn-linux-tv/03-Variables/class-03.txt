1. Variable structure:
		myname="John"
	name -> = -> content
	No spaces!
2. You can declare variables right on the command line, there isn't much difference between entering commands on the
command line and adding commands to a script.
3. Use $ before variable name to echo it, e.g.:

	echo $myname

   Bash treats names written after $ as variables.
4. When you declare a variable in bash, it's tied to the session it was declared in. If you terminate the session, the
variable will be gone.  
5. If single quotes are used for strings, contents of the variables will not be
printed.
6. You can store output of commands in variables, e.g.:
	files=$(ls)
$() is called a subshell
7. Within your environment, there are already variables that are declared, 
$USER is one of those, it contains the name of the user you're currently logged
in as. Variables like $USER are called system variables or environment variables
8. It is a good practice to declare variables in lower case.
9. To find out what variables are defined, type 'env'
