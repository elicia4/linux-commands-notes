Data Streams:

	- Standard Input
	- Standard Output
	- Standard Error

Data streams allow us to control where normal output goes as well as where 
errors are printed. They allow us to accept input from the user as well. This
concept is very important Linux-wide.

ls command is an example of Standard Output. Whenever we execute a command, and
the results of that command get printed onto the screen, it is Standard Output.
Standard Ouput is output that is printed on the screen that doesn't constitute
an error. To tell the difference between Standard Output (SO) and Standard Error
(SE):

    echo $?

Non-zero = SE, zero = SO. Let's take a look at an example of both SO and SE. Use
the find command, which allows you to find directories or files with a search
criteria:

    find /etc -type f 

It will return every object that is a file. There are many many SO results as
well as SE results (i.e. permisson denied results). 

To distinguish between SO and SE:

    find /etc -type f 2> /dev/null

No SE results appeared. '>' redirects stuff to a file. /dev/null is a special
place, everything you redirect to it gets completely wiped out. Think of it as a
black hole. 2 means all error results, any output that consttues SE. Let's try
something else:

    find /etc -type f > /dev/null

Only the SE results appeared. Only Standard Output was sent to /dev/null. 
Another example:

    find /etc -type f 1> /dev/null

This will yield the same result. 1 = SO, 2 = SE. To send both to a file:

    find /etc -type f &> file.txt

You can send SO to one file and SE to another file:

    find /etc -type f 1> output.txt 2> error.txt
