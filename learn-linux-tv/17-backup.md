# Backup Script

[***go back to contents***](01-contents.md)

Everything is explained in the script's comments.

Create two directories, source and destination. Add some files to source and
run the script with and then without `--dry-run` to test it. Then change one of
the files, run it again and check the logs. It should only update the file you
changed.
