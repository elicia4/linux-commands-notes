# Exploring the System

- `file` – determine file type
- `less` – view file contents

You can list multiple directories with `ls`:

```
ls <dir-1> <dir-2> <...>
```

- `-t` - sort the result by the file's modification time.
- `-r` `--reverse` - reverse the order of the sort,
- `-A` `--almost-all` - like the `-a` option above except it does not
list `.` (current directory) and `..` (parent directory).
- `-d` `--directory` - use this option in conjunction with the `-l` option to
  see details about the directory rather than its contents.
- `-F` `--classify` - this option will append an indicator character to the end
  of each listed name. For example, a forward slash (`/`) if the name is a
  directory.
- `-S` - sort results by file size.
