Like Windows, a Unix-like operating system such as Linux organizes its files in
what is called a **hierarchical directory structure**. This means they are
organized in a tree-like pattern of directories (sometimes called folders in
other systems), which may contain files and other directories. The first
directory in the file system is called the **root directory**.

Unix-like systems such as Linux always have a single file system tree,
regardless of how many drives or storage devices are attached to the computer.
Storage devices are mounted at various points on the tree according to the
whims of the person responsible for the maintenance of the system. 

Some useful shortcuts with `cd`:

- `cd -` changes the working directory to the previous working directory.
- `cd ~user_name` changes the working directory to the home directory of
  `user_name`.
